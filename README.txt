# AgeGenderDeepLearning

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to assist readers in reproducing our results on age and gender classification for facial images as described in the following work:

Gil Levi and Tal Hassner, Age and Gender Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE Workshop on Analysis and Modeling of Faces and Gestures (AMFG), at the IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Boston, June 2017

Project page: http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/

The code contains the original meta-data files with age and gender labels, a python script for creating prototxt file in order to create the lmdb's for training and shell files for creating the lmdb and mean images. 
We have also uploaded an ipython notetebook with example usage of our emotion classification networks from our paper: 
Gil Levi and Tal Hassner, Emotion Recognition in the Wild via Convolutional Neural Networks and Mapped Binary Patterns, Proc. ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI), Seattle, Nov. 2015

If you find our models or code useful, please add suitable reference to our paper in your work.
